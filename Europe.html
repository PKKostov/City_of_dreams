<h2><center><b>1. London</b></center></h2>
<p><center>The city has long been a magnet for smart talent. London ranks #2 in the world for percentage of the population with post-secondary education, and #11 for the quality of its universities. In September 2019, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings listed four London universities in the top 40—more than any other city in the world. Where the city consistently excels is in Programming—#1 again this year—which includes restaurants, nightlife and shopping. London has established a Night Time Commission and appointed a Night Czar. London First and Ernst & Young found that, in 2014, the nighttime economy was worth almost $35 billion annually and directly supported one in eight jobs—or 723,000 workers. To boost the nighttime experience, the city runs parts of its tube system 24 hours a day, to the delight of the 8.7 million riders who used it in 2018.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>2. Rome</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Few cities serve up the ability to walk the history of the Western world like Roma. Heck, just Palatine Hill invites you into two millennia of Western Civilization, if you’ve got an hour. Mix in a safe, accessible modern city amidst thousands of portals back in time and it’s easy to see how Rome cracked the Best Cities Top 10 for the first time this year. Declarations of love for the city have multiplied with the channels of self-expression, of course, and the city’s #4 ranking in our extensive Place category has directly fueled its #5 Promotion ranking, including the second-most TripAdvisor reviews on the planet and very frequent Google searches.</center></p>

<p><center>Sofia is Bulgaria’s capital and largest city. Situated in the very heart of the Balkan peninsula,  it is one of Europe’s oldest cities. While still undiscovered by many, more and more people are now falling in love with the city’s unique east meets west vibe.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>4. Berlin</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Expats, creatives, entrepreneurs, immigrants, punks and misfits all find their place in Berlin, a city where remnants of its fragile history mingle with an ever-changing present, and where being whatever you want to be is not just encouraged but embraced. Indeed, the city has an annual festival, Karneval der Kulturen, that celebrates diversity and, of course, the Berlin Pride Celebration is arguably the biggest and most popular LGBTQ+ parade in all of Europe. In winter, bars are packed to the gills, art galleries overflow and techno clubs pulse into the wee hours. As soon as the sun comes out, the entire city heads outdoors, to the parks, the beer gardens and one street party or parade after another. Berlin ranks #5 for Nightlife and #7 for Museums.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>5. Madrid</b></center></h2>
<p><center>In Madrid, everything old is new again. With much-needed investment in its bounteous (but long-dormant) infrastructure and public assets, the Spanish capital is finally reviving its city-building legacy. It’s not just the well-known cultural richness (although the Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums have all expanded over the past few years). Madrid is, more importantly, finally committed to the modern reinvention of the city focused on its citizenry. The city’s #18 ranking in our Neighborhoods & Landmarks category is certain to improve, given long overdue big-budget projects like making the central Gran Vía boulevard far more pedestrian friendly. The city with the #6 best Nightlife on the planet (just behind Berlin and ahead of Paris) is finally making it easier and more pleasant to stay out late.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>6. Valencia</b></center></h2>
<p><center>The Spanish city ranks #29 globally for Place, which includes its weather—the 15th best in the world—along with neighborhoods, landmarks and monuments, and parks and outdoor activities. For instance, here’s a landmark: the UNESCO World Heritage site called La Lonja, the 15th-century silk exchange and one of the best examples of Gothic civil architecture in Europe. The Mercado Central, one of Europe’s largest and oldest food markets, is across the street. The futuristic City of Arts and Sciences, designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela, is a marvel of a more modern sort. Valencia’s parks include several beaches, some within Albufera Park, a wetlands reserve with a lake and walking trails. It’s all very Instagrammable and helps the city rank #55 for Instagram hashtags.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>7. Moscow</b></center></h2>
<p><center>First timers and regulars fall under the spell of Moscow the minute they set foot in this endlessly fascinating and dynamic metropolis. Curiosity about Russia has increased as political intrigue has grown, of course, which might explain why Moscow was the top-hashtagged city on Instagram. The city offers a bounty of classic attractions, including the masterpiece of Russian architecture that is St. Basil’s Cathedral; the Kremlin and Red Square, two UNESCO Heritage Sites that are also the historic and spiritual heart of the city; and, of course, Gorky Park. But the city also rewards venturing off the beaten path, with bizarre bars, tasty and increasingly locally sourced meals, and daring fashion boutiques.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>8. Lisbon</b></center></h2>
<p><center>The Portuguese capital is a tactile, multisensory experience best explored on foot with no particular agenda, allowing a few of the 2,799 hours of sunshine a year—the most of any European capital—to warm your sense of discovery. Its seven hills play with the senses, reverberating sounds, light and scents, to say nothing of providing perches from which to watch the sun setting ablaze the yellow and white architecture—and the Atlantic beyond. To save you some time, the best spot to do so is the Castelo de São Jorge, a view you have to earn through winding ancient alleys in one of Europe’s oldest neighborhoods.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>9. Paris</b></center></h2>
<p><center>While 2018 was another record year for Paris tourism visitations (38 million), France is targeting 100 million foreign tourists for 2020. The city nabs the top spot in our Shopping category, beating out New York and London for the first time. In 2020, the full renovation of Les Ateliers Gaîté shopping mall, near Montparnasse Tower, will open for business, with more than 100 shops on three floors and a 25-restaurant food hall. Not to be outdone, architect Bjarke Ingels will unveil the massive Europa City mixed-use development in the city’s northern agricultural district of Triangle de Gonesse.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>10. Vienna</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Fresh ideas are blowing through the city where modernism was born—the 4th district seems to be just one hub of change on its own. Better tasting coffee is coming to the UNESCO-ranked coffeehouses, like the Landtmann and the Central—places where radical philosophical and aesthetic movements were hatched over mediocre joe. And along with Gustav Klimt at the Schloss Belvedere and Egon Schiele at the Leopold, there’s a dynamic contemporary art scene made up of places like TBA21 and the Museum of Applied Arts—which combines applied art, design, architecture and contemporary art in historic splendor. The annual Vienna Design Week is an anticipated takeover of the entire city. Not for nothing does Vienna rank #34 overall for its Programming.<center></p>
