<h2><center><b>1. Tokyo</b></center></h2>

<p><center>Despite earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons, Japan perseveres and Tokyo, with its round-the-clock kinetic mobility, innovation and efficiency, continues to mesmerize global visitors. It ranks #6 for Neighborhoods & Landmarks and #16 for Outdoors. Indeed, parks are considered vital infrastructure here, and essential therapy for its vertical-living citizens. Take, for instance, Meiji Jingu shrine, which is tucked into dense woodland in the heart of the city and celebrates its centennial anniversary in 2020. Then there’s teamLab Borderless in the Mori Building, a new kind of digital art museum without boundaries, where visitors wander and explore, map-free, while immersing themselves in a three-dimensional world. This is just the latest addition to the city’s 250-plus museums. It’s no wonder, then, that Tokyo ranks #4 globally in our Museums category.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>2. Istanbul</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Istanbul is a city of contradictions if there ever was one: minarets and church spires dot the colorful skyline, while down at street level women in black abayas and those in tight-fitting Armani dresses walk side by side. A few more steps away, Arabic house music from sidewalk cafés and bars all but drowns out the call to prayer. Get your bearings with a walk down Istiklal Caddesi, a pedestrian avenue in the Beyoğlu district that fuses modern with tradition to great effect. Here, impressive 19th-century buildings house cultural centers, shops, restaurants and cafes, such as Urban, a good spot for a midday coffee or a pre-club drink. Get your culture on at Istanbul Modern, a museum that focuses on local contemporary art.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>3. Singapore</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Only in Singapore does an airport become a must-see attraction, one that receives millions of passengers a year but also lures locals with a bounty of designer shops, gardens, gourmet food, and one-of-a-kind sights. Opened last April and designed by Safdie Architects, the new $1.7-billion Jewel Changi Airport features a canopy bridge and glass walkway shrouded in fog and suspended 75 feet in the air. But the real showstopper is the seven-story Rain Vortex, an indoor waterfall (the world’s tallest) that cascades down from a central oculus in the roof. Although Singapore lands at #42 for Airport Connectivity, it would medal for its gateway’s experience alone if we scored such things.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>4. Hong Kong</b></center></h2>
<p><center>The East-meets-West spirit of the place; the forest of skyscrapers as seen on a hike to Pok Fu Lam Reservoir; the sounds, smells and tastes from the dai pai dong (open-air food stalls) of Temple Street Night Market and the city’s electric pulse all captivate visitors and locals alike. The sublime embrace of the city was shattered in April 2019 when Hong Kong citizens opposing a law to extradite criminal cases to China first took to the streets. The demands quickly spread to broader human rights reforms targeting China’s encroachment on the region. After dozens of injuries and millions in damage, the extradition bill was removed in late October, but unrest persists.</center></p>

<h2><center><b>5. New Delhi</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Honk, beep, moo! Vans, scooters, rickshaws, street food sellers, beggars, cows and even monkeys come together in the Indian capital. There are few places on earth that pulsate with the hectic pace like Delhi does, which explains its #18 spot for Place, including a #29 ranking for Neighborhoods & Landmarks. Indeed, Delhi is a city built upon or near the ruins of a previous city, and today visitors can trace through the eras, exploring centuries-old forts, tombs, shrines and mosques. Old Delhi is where to soak it all in while weaving in and out of the chaos, shopping for trinkets and handicrafts in the frenetic street bazaars and gaping in wonder at the Red Fort. Unsurprisingly, Delhi also ranks high (#16) for Restaurants, and sampling everything you can is a must.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>6. Shanghai</b></center></h2>
<p><center>This powerhouse of finance, international trade, culture, science and technology ranks #10 for the number of Global 500 companies headquartered here. Yet Shanghai is made of more than money, and the city is lauded for its exhilarating blend of past and present, industry and leisure. It ranks #17 for Shopping, #7 for Restaurants and #30 for Neighborhoods & Landmarks. This eminently walkable city and its personality are split by the Huangpu River: Pudong (east bank) is the financial district, fringed with towers that include the landmark spike of the retro-futuristic Oriental Pearl Television Tower. Puxi (west bank) is home to the Bund, lined with the neo-Renaissance edifices that were home to Western businesses in the 1930s, and to the wonderfully layered French Concession.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>7. Seoul</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Seoul is a city where you can feed your mind and body. Take, for example, its Top 10 ranking for Museums, #16 for Attractions and top spot for Restaurants. Start your visit at Zaha Hadid’s futuristic Dongdaemun Design Plaza, then, for a deep dive into the soul of Koreans, visit the National Folk Museum of Korea, which includes a room devoted to the deep and pervasive roots of Confucianism. Still hungry? Explore Mukja Golmok, literally “Let’s Eat Alley,” the vegetable-centric Temple Cuisine at Dooreyoo, Michelin-starred chef Tony Yoo’s oasis, and Gwangjang Market, a century-old food hall where you can eat everything from a soup of rice cakes and kimchi-tofu dumplings to squirmy live octopus (really).<center></p>

<h2><center><b>8. Jakarta</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Jakarta, Indonesia's massive capital, sits on the northwest coast of the island of Java. A historic mix of cultures – Javanese, Malay, Chinese, Arab, Indian and European – has influenced its architecture, language and cuisine. The old town, Kota Tua, is home to Dutch colonial buildings, Glodok (Jakarta’s Chinatown) and the old port of Sunda Kelapa, where traditional wooden schooners dock.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>9. Dubai</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Dubai is where you can ride the elevator to the top of the world’s tallest building for a bird’s-eye view, bet on the ponies at the world’s richest horse race and pose for photos in front of the world’s tallest choreographed fountains. The most visited mall on the planet is also here, and helps land Dubai at #30 in our Shopping category. New for 2019 is Cityland Mall, the world’s first “nature inspired” shopping mall, packed with botanical touches including 200,000 square feet of open-air gardens. Santiago Calatrava’s The Tower at Dubai Creek will eclipse the Burj Khalifa as the tallest building in the world when completed in 2020.<center></p>

<h2><center><b>10. Kathmandu</b></center></h2>
<p><center>Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake. Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt.<center></p>
